			</div>
			<div class="details">
				<p><b>Detail Information:<br></b>At first glance Shadowverse plays very similarly to Hearthstone, with matches structured between two players taking turns playing cards from their deck. Each player is represented by a Leader with 20 defense and a starting hand of three cards. The player going first has two evolution points, and the player going second has three evolution points, can evolve one turn earlier, and draws an extra card at the player's first turn. The objective of the player is to reduce the other player's defense to 0 or attain a win via certain cards (e.g. Enstatued Seraph).
				Each player utilizes the Play Point resource to play cards. Both players begin at having zero play point orbs, and gain one play point orb at the beginning of the respective player's turn, up to a limit of 10. Play Point orbs are refilled at the beginning of each player's turn.At first glance Shadowverse plays very similarly to Hearthstone, with matches structured between two players taking turns playing cards from their deck.
